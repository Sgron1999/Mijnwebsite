            <p>It's about seeing everything and seeing nothing. The lines and blobs that eat away at the empty space.</p>
            <p>Lines are like scratches on ice, whereas blobs are like oil on water. It stays liquid until the water dries up.</p>
            <p>My sights and experiences enveloped by a rope of paint from a painting, a painting that gets interwoven with the viewer's eyes. That's how my inner world and their experiences become one. It's not about what I do, but about what I've seen. It's the bamboo in the garden that I saw rustling in the wind when I was a child. It's about the window during wintertime, my mother could not pull me away from this window, not even to put on my slippers. I wanted to look outside. I don't make. I admire and spit out. Isn't everything in essence made up out of blobs and lines.</p>
